                <strong>INFORMED CONSENT FORM FOR RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TULSA</strong>

                <br><br>

                <strong> - INTRODUCTION:</strong><br>
                The name of this study is Not All Explanations are Created Equal: Investigating the Pitfalls of Current XAI Evaluation". The people working on this project are Joe Shymanski and Jacob Brue, graduate students of Computer Science, under the supervision of Dr. Sandip Sen, PhD, Professor of Computer Science at The University of Tulsa. This document defines the terms and conditions for agreeing to participate in this research study.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHY IS THIS RESEARCH STUDY BEING DONE?</strong><br>
                The long-term goal of the research is to highlight the ways in which the current techniques used for evaluating computer-generated explanations are insufficient for proving their effectiveness.

                We are interested in understanding what makes explanations effective for human satisfaction, understandability, and performance.

                <br><br>

                <strong>WHAT IS THE KEY INFORMATION YOU NEED TO HELP YOU DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY OR NOT?</strong>

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHAT ARE YOU BEING ASKED TO DO?</strong><br>
                If you agree to be in this study, you are being asked to:<br><br>

                - Complete a short background survey.<br>
                - Attempt to solve a series of chess puzzles.<br>
                - Complete a user satisfaction survey regarding your experience.<br><br>

                You must complete this study in one sitting, which should take 25 minutes. There are timed sections that will automatically move on if you reach the time limit. Please avoid mobile devices, as the study is similar to a game; small screens don't show full information.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - ANY POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS?</strong><br>
                No foreseeable risks or discomforts, beyond those present in routine daily life, are anticipated in this study.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - ANY DIRECT BENEFITS FOR YOU?</strong><br>
                Although there are no direct benefits for you, you will help the researchers identify key metrics that must be accounted for when evaluating computer-generated explanations for humans in the future.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - ANY PAID COMPENSATION FOR YOUR TIME?</strong><br>
                If you completed the task in its entirety (all experiments and surveys) and provided valid responses 
                during the study, you will be paid $2.50 through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Additional payments, of up 
                to $1.00, will be paid depending on performance, which is based on how many incorrect moves you make
                in each test puzzle (20&cent per test puzzle completed minus 4&cent per incorrect move).
                <br><br>
                To make sure you are paying attention, the study includes 3 attention checks throughout the study. If you fail more than 1 of the attention checks, your work will be terminated, and no compensation will be provided. You will not be able to continue the study. These checks include simple questions, that are common knowledge, as well as questions about the study itself. If you are paying attention, you should have no problem answering these questions correctly.
                <br><br>
                At the end of the study, you will receive a code. Please do not submit HIT without the code, as you may risk being rejected.
                <br><br>
                Important: If you don't think that you have answered the responses thoughtfully and you are not sure you will pass a validity check, you should not submit your HIT.
                <br><br>
                You will only receive the compensation if you complete this study to its entirety (all experiments and surveys) and pass the validity and consistency checks within the 45-minute time limit. Please understand that we need to enforce these requirements to ensure the scientific validity of our experimental results.
                <br><br>
                Do not hit back/refresh buttons on browser, or any browser manipulation, as it may affect the study, and violate the terms of the study, and may result in rejections.
                If you have any issues, please email one of us (joe-shymanski@utulsa.edu or jacob-brue@utulsa.edu), and we can review the logs to see what happened and help you.
                <br><br>

                <strong> - HOW WILL YOUR INFORMATION/PRIVACY BE PROTECTED?</strong><br>
                During the study, you will not be asked any personal information except your MTurk worker ID (i.e., the 14 character sequence of letters and numbers used to identify workers). Your worker ID is necessary to link your work and worker ID for compensation. In other words, we need your worker ID to confirm that you successfully completed the task and to determine the exact amount of compensation based on your score in the study.
                <br><br>
                Your MTurk worker ID will NOT be shared with anyone and will be kept on the researcher's password-protected computer and then deleted from our system after completing the study. The unidentifiable data will be kept on the researcher’s password-protected file, only accessible to the researcher. Furthermore, the web application where you will work on the task does not read/record your IP, location, or any other personal information.

                <br><br>Please note that MTurk has specific privacy policies of their own. If you have concerns, you should consult them directly at <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/privacynotice" target="_blank">https://www.mturk.com/mturk/privacynotice</a>

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHAT IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS THE RESEARCHERS PLAN TO RECRUIT FOR THIS STUDY?</strong><br>
                We expect to recruit up to 500 subjects for this study.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR PARTICIPATION AND CAN YOU LEAVE THE STUDY BEFORE IT ENDS?</strong><br>
                You must be at least 18 years old, reside in the United States, be proficient in the English language, and know the basic rules of chess to participate in this study. Participation is voluntary. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your participation in this study is approximately 25 minutes. However, you can leave the study at any time, even if you have not finished, but you will be compensated only based on the compensation rules listed earlier.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - CAN YOUR INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THIS STUDY BE SHARED OR USED BY OTHERS?</strong><br>
                Your identifiable information (MTurk worker ID) collected for this research study will not be used or distributed to other investigators for future research studies, even if your identifiers are removed.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - HOW WILL THE RESULTS BE USED?</strong><br>
                Results of this study, including summarized analysis of aggregated survey data, may be published on websites and in peer-reviewed conference proceedings, journals, and presentations. All surveys and modification efforts will be identified with random numbers. The data collected will be aggregated and used for research. As the data will be summarized across all participants, we will not be able to identify you from your data.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHO CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STUDY?</strong><br>
